# Generic Cardano Mint Script, with On-Chain Record of Mints

A Cardano validator written in [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org) which allows
minting NFTs with on-chain guarantee than no single asset is minted more than
once.

This validator can further be extended to also support a hard cap for the total
number of NFTs that can be minted for a collection.
